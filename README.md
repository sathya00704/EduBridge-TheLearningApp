**DETAILS:**
Our team, named 'ICT REBOOTERS', took part in the PSGiTech Hackfest-2023, a national level hackathon organized by PSG Institute of Technology and Applied Research. 
We picked the theme **"Equal Access to Education and Opportunities to promote economic growth and advancing human rights."** Our idea was to create a mobile app that could work even in places with slow internet, so that education could reach far-off areas. We made sure the app could be used in different local languages and also had strong security to protect user data. The app we made, called 'EduBridge,' had cool features like Assessment Improvement Rate, flashcards, and a new word every day.
