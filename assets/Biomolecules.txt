BIOMOLECULES

1. Introduction to Biomolecules:
   - Biomolecules are molecules that are essential for life processes and are found in living organisms.
   - They can be categorized into four major types: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.

2. Carbohydrates:
   - Carbohydrates are organic compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
   - They serve as energy sources and structural components.
   - Monosaccharides are the simplest carbohydrates (glucose, fructose, galactose).
   - Disaccharides consist of two monosaccharide units (sucrose, lactose, maltose).
   - Polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates made of multiple monosaccharide units (starch, cellulose, glycogen).

3. Proteins:
   - Proteins are complex macromolecules composed of amino acids.
   - They have diverse functions: enzymes, hormones, structural components, etc.
   - The primary structure of a protein is the sequence of amino acids.
   - Secondary structure involves folding into alpha helices and beta sheets.
   - Tertiary structure is the overall three-dimensional arrangement.
   - Quaternary structure is the arrangement of multiple protein subunits.

4. Lipids:
   - Lipids are hydrophobic molecules like fats, oils, and phospholipids.
   - They are used for energy storage, insulation, and cell membrane structure.
   - Triglycerides consist of glycerol and three fatty acid chains.
   - Phospholipids are crucial components of cell membranes.
   - Steroids are a type of lipid, including cholesterol and hormones.

5. Nucleic Acids:
   - Nucleic acids include DNA and RNA, which store and transmit genetic information.
   - Nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids.
   - DNA has a double-helix structure, formed by complementary base pairing (A-T, C-G).
   - RNA is involved in protein synthesis and comes in various types (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA).

6. Enzymes:
   - Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions.
   - They are highly specific and work under mild conditions.
   - Enzymes lower the activation energy required for a reaction.
   - Enzyme activity can be affected by factors like temperature, pH, and substrate concentration.

7. Hormones:
   - Hormones are chemical messengers that regulate various physiological processes.
   - Examples include insulin, adrenaline, estrogen, and testosterone.
   - Hormones can be proteins, peptides, or steroids.

8. Nucleic Acid Replication and Protein Synthesis:
   - DNA replication ensures genetic continuity during cell division.
   - Transcription is the process of making mRNA from DNA.
   - Translation involves converting mRNA into protein using tRNA and ribosomes.

9. Biochemical Techniques:
   - Techniques like chromatography, electrophoresis, and spectrophotometry are used to study biomolecules.
