Acids release H+; taste sour; turn litmus red. Bases release OH-; feel slippery; turn litmus blue. React in neutralization.

1. Acids:
Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions (H+) when dissolved in water.
Properties of acids include sour taste, ability to turn blue litmus paper red, and ability to react with metals to release hydrogen gas.
Examples: Hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), acetic acid (CH3COOH).

2. Bases:
Bases are substances that release hydroxide ions (OH-) when dissolved in water.
Properties of bases include bitter taste, slippery feel, ability to turn red litmus paper blue, and ability to neutralize acids.
Examples: Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), ammonia (NH3).

3. Arrhenius Theory:
Acid according to Arrhenius: Substance that produces H+ ions in water.
Base according to Arrhenius: Substance that produces OH- ions in water.

4. Bronsted-Lowry Theory:
Acid according to Bronsted-Lowry: Substance that donates a proton (H+).
Base according to Bronsted-Lowry: Substance that accepts a proton.

5. Lewis Theory:
Acid according to Lewis: Substance that accepts an electron pair.
Base according to Lewis: Substance that donates an electron pair.

6. pH Scale:
Measures the acidity or alkalinity of a solution.
pH values range from 0 to 14.
pH < 7 indicates acidic solutions, pH > 7 indicates basic (alkaline) solutions, pH = 7 indicates neutral.

7. Neutralization Reaction:
Reaction between an acid and a base to form water and a salt.
H+ from the acid combines with OH- from the base to form water (H2O).
Example: HCl + NaOH â†’ NaCl + H2O.

8. Strong and Weak Acids/Bases:
Strong acids/bases ionize completely in water.
Weak acids/bases ionize only partially.
Example of strong acids: HCl, H2SO4; strong bases: NaOH, KOH.

9. Buffer Solutions:
Solutions that resist drastic changes in pH when an acid or base is added.
Contains a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid.

10. Indicators:
Substances that change color in the presence of acids or bases.
Litmus paper, phenolphthalein, and universal indicator are commonly used indicators.
