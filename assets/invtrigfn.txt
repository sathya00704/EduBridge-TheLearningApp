INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS

1. Introduction to Inverse Trigonometric Functions:
   - Inverse trigonometric functions are used to find angles for given trigonometric ratios.
   - They are denoted as sin^(-1)x, cos^(-1)x, tan^(-1)x, etc.
   - The principal value of these functions lies within specific domains.

2. Principal Values and Ranges:
   - The principal value of an inverse trigonometric function lies within a specific range:
     - sin^(-1)x: [-π/2, π/2]
     - cos^(-1)x: [0, π]
     - tan^(-1)x: (-π/2, π/2)
   - These ranges ensure that each value of x corresponds to a unique value of the inverse trigonometric function.

3. Properties of Inverse Trigonometric Functions:
   - Domain and range restrictions for the inverse trigonometric functions ensure one-to-one correspondence.
   - Symmetry properties: sin^(-1)(-x) = -sin^(-1)x, cos^(-1)(-x) = π - cos^(-1)x, tan^(-1)(-x) = -tan^(-1)x.
   - Relationships like sin(sin^(-1)x) = x, cos(cos^(-1)x) = x, and tan(tan^(-1)x) = x.

4. Trigonometric Equations and Inverse Trigonometric Functions:
   - Inverse trigonometric functions are used to solve equations involving trigonometric ratios.

5. Evaluation of Inverse Trigonometric Functions:
   - Values of inverse trigonometric functions can be found using geometric reasoning, graphs, or calculators.
   - Special values like sin^(-1)(1/2) = π/6, cos^(-1)(1/2) = π/3, tan^(-1)(1) = π/4, etc.

6. Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions:
   - Derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions are essential in calculus.
   - Example derivatives: (d/dx)(sin^(-1)x) = 1/√(1 - x^2), (d/dx)(cos^(-1)x) = -1/√(1 - x^2), (d/dx)(tan^(-1)x) = 1/(1 + x^2).

7. Integration of Inverse Trigonometric Functions:
   - Integration involving inverse trigonometric functions can be solved using techniques like substitution.

8. Application in Solving Triangles:
   - Inverse trigonometric functions are used to solve triangles when sides and angles are given.

9. Inverse Trigonometric Function Identities:
   - Relationships like sin^(-1)x + cos^(-1)x = π/2, tan^(-1)x + tan^(-1)(1/x) = π/4 are useful in solving problems.

10. Trigonometric Equations with Inverse Trigonometric Functions:
    - Some equations can be solved using properties of inverse trigonometric functions.
