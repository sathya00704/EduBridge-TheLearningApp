CURRENT ELECTRICITY

1. Electric Current and Electric Charge:
- Electric current is the flow of electric charge through a conductor.
- Electric charge is quantized, with the elementary charge being the charge of an electron.
- Current is defined as the rate of flow of charge: I = dq/dt, where (I is current, dq is the infinitesimal charge, and dt is the infinitesimal time.

2. Ohm's Law and Resistance:
- Ohm's Law relates current, voltage, and resistance: V = IR, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.
- Resistance is the property of a material to oppose the flow of electric current.
- The resistance of a conductor depends on its dimensions, material, and temperature.
- The unit of resistance is the ohm.

3. Electrical Resistivity and Conductivity:
- Resistivity (rho) is a material property that determines its resistance for a given length and cross-sectional area.
- Conductivity (sigma) is the reciprocal of resistivity: (sigma = 1\rho).

4. Factors Affecting Resistance:
- Length and cross-sectional area: Resistance is directly proportional to length and inversely proportional to cross-sectional area 
- Temperature: Generally, resistance increases with temperature for most conductors.
- Temperature coefficient of resistance: (alpha) is the fractional change in resistance per degree Celsius: 
alpha = 1/R * Dr /dT

5. Series and Parallel Combinations of Resistors:
- Resistors in series: Total resistance (Rtotal ) is the sum of individual resistances.
- Resistors in parallel: The reciprocal of total resistance (1/Rtotal) is the sum of the reciprocals of individual resistances.

6. Electric Power and Energy:
- Electric power (P) is the rate of doing work or delivering energy: 
P = IV = I^2R = V^2/R
- Energy consumed (W) is the product of power and time: (W = Pt).

7. Cells and EMF:
- Electromotive Force (EMF) is the potential difference across the terminals of a cell when it's not connected to a circuit.
- Internal resistance (r) of a cell represents the opposition to current flow within the cell.

8. Kirchhoff's Laws:
- Kirchhoff's First Law (Node Law): The sum of currents entering a junction (node) in a circuit equals the sum of currents leaving the junction.
- Kirchhoff's Second Law (Loop Law): The sum of electromotive forces (EMFs) and potential drops in a closed loop of a circuit is zero.

9. Wheatstone Bridge:
- A Wheatstone Bridge is used to measure unknown resistances by comparing them to known resistances in a balanced condition.

10. Potentiometer:
- A potentiometer is a device used to measure potential difference and electromotive force accurately.
- It works on the principle of comparing the unknown voltage with a known voltage across a length of uniform wire.

These are some of the important key points from the "Current Electricity" chapter.
